#### I am nervous about a presentation I have to make at an upcoming press conference.
### I can see why you might be nervous.
#### I've made an outline of what I'm going to say. I've also practiced. So it seems natural. Is there anything else I should keep in mind?
### Make sure to introduce yourself to the audience. You also need to have an attention-getting introduction and a strong conclusion. These are the most important parts of a presentation.
#### That makes a lot of sense. How about body languaue and tone of voice?
### Use gestures to highlight your points. But don't overdo it. Too many movements can be distracting. Oh, and properly explian visuals, such as graphs in your slides, to the audiences. However, don't read straight from the slides.
#### I know that I also shouldn't speak in a monotone voice. It will put people to sleep.
### That's right. In terms of your delivery, think about chunking information into three: for example, "Our product is safe, reliable, and effective." Repeating important information during your presentaion also makes a greater impact and helps the audience remember important points.
#### I see.
### One more thing: humor is an effective way to establish rapport with your audience.
